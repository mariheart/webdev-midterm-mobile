                    <p>February 22, 2020 is the most humiliating regular-season loss in NHL history, according to both
                        Leafs fans and analysts. One would think that Kyle Dubas, the Leafs' General Manager, would sell
                        the team and throw everything he had built up in the gutter. The players said it themselves;
                        it's a matter of 'willpower.' Even though the Leafs, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O4Z8evcWZg&t=2403s">according to Adam Wylde and Steve Dangle in
                        the Steve Dangle Podcast</a>, objectively have the <b>best coaching / health / analyzing staff in

                <div class="text">
                    <p>Despite this, Toronto has turned over a new leaf. They won 3 straight games, including against
                        the Tampa Bay Lightning, the best regular-season team so far. Many people are saying that the
                        loss "humbled" the Leafs and reminded them of their drive to make the playoffs and win the
                        Stanley Cup.</p>

                    <p>The Hurricanes lose four straight after that game. As of the making of this website, they are one
                        behind the Islanders for a wild card spot. They have the manpower to squeeze in at the final day

                        his jersey sold in large numbers, Ayres was living the dream. He even has his stick in the
                        Hockey Hall of Fame! On top of that, <a

                            after both Carolina goaltenders were injured. In his surprise NHL debut, he helped Carolina

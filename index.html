            <div class="text">
                <p>The Toronto Maple Leafs are currently fighting for a playoff spot. They stand third in the Atlantic
                    Division, behind the Boston Bruins and the Tampa Bay Lightning. They need every point they can get.
                    It's February 22, 2020. The 40th anniversary of the Miracle on Ice, where the United States defeats
                    the Soviet Union to earn a gold medal in the 1980 Winter Olympics. The Carolina Hurricanes are down
                    two goaltenders, James Reimer and Petr Mrazek, due to freak accidents. The game is in the bag, the
                    Maple Leafs think. Little did they know the reckoning was upon them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <h1>Enter David Ayres, a 42-year-old practice goalie and zamboni driver for the Toronto Marlies, the
                    Maple Leafs' minor affiliate.</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p> Dressed in borrowed gear and blue pants not matching the Hurricanes' red, he stands tall as a brick
                    wall against the Maple Leafs' $50 million offensive powers of Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner, and
                    John Tavares. He, with the help of the Hurricanes, humiliates the Leafs in a 6-3 win, giving the
                    Hurricanes a shot at the playoffs, and providing both a heartwarming story of dreams coming true and
                    a cold, hard look at just what a team built on offense is truly made of.</p>

                <p><a
                        href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/can-maple-leafs-recover-embarrassing-loss-zamboni-driver/">According
                        to Luke Fox of Sportsnet</a>, one must "wonder what it must be like to be paid millions of
                    dollars to put the puck in the net and somehow be unable to do so against a 42-year-old Zamboni
                    driver, a fan of the very shooters he’s competing against, an unpaid volunteer coming in cold and
                    wearing borrowed gear." The interesting part about this is that the Leafs rallied from 4-0 last game
                    against the Pittsburgh Penguins, known titans of hockey with various superstars including Sidney
                    Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, and won. Their offense shone in that game! Where were they in <i>this</i>
                    game which was practically handed to them on a silver platter? Especially, as Steve Dangle notes in
                    the above video, in the final game before the trade deadline, in which players on the free agency
                    market are supposed to show off the best of themselves?</p>
                <p>Rather than show off their best, the Maple Leafs looked like insufferable parodies of themselves.
                    Luke Fox
                    notes: "Ayres turned away three Auston Matthews’ shots. Mitch Marner stumbled over his own feet.
                    Despite playing 200 feet away from the Leafs’ net, Ayres himself registered more shots on goal (one)
                    in half a game than William Nylander (zero) did the full 60." Compared to the game versus
                    Pittsburgh, not only do the Leafs look like they're not a playoff team, they look more like they're
                    aiming for a draft lottery pick. Many are calling this game the most embarassing regular-season loss
                    in NHL history, and with good reason.</p>
                <h1>TL;DR: A fifty-million-dollar offense could not put in a goal past a volunteer zamboni
                    driver-turned-goalie
                    and a $500K defense.</h1>
